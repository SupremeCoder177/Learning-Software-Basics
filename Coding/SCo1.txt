Chapter SCo1

Well it is finally the time for which you might have begun to read this series.

Coding, no more jokes, just pure technical knowledge impartment from now on.

A program is a basically a text file with a bunch of instrcution which the CPU can read and execute, and the process of making these files is called coding.
Now since the reason why the instructor matters very much in the success of an athelete, the same is the case here. Coding is done using tools to instruct the 
computer to do certain things. How well you can make it to do it, depends on the one using the tools.

Tools in this sense are the rules or the syntax of the language being used to make the program. Just like how in languages grammer matters, in coding, syntax matters.
The CPU only understand a proper syntax there is no expection for any kind of errors, and there are many ways to do the same task, some take more time than the others,
while others don't. It is all about optimizing programs for the best possible result.
