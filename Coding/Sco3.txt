Chapter SCo3

Loops are statements in coding which excecute continously until a certain condition is met
Like for example

i = 0
while i < 10:
	print("Hello there)
	i = i + 1 (or i += 1)

Here the statement "Hello There" is going to be printed to the console 10 times because the statemtent is going
to execute while i < 10, and i = 0 at the start and is incremented by 1 in each cycle 

Of course you can do math with this as well
you can do stuff like

a = 10
b = cos(10)
c = sin(a + b) / tan(pi / a)
print(c)

And there you have it, this is all of coding, complete.

But I know what you are thinking but this can't be, coding is supposed to be complicated and really boring, this is too easy.
There is literally 3 things you can do, make conditions, loops and do math. Is that all?

How in the hell are we able to make things like realistic games etc with just this?
Well this is where coding gets interesting and we need to dive deep into history of computers to understand this.
